This project utilises Machine Learning concepts to make predictions on whether a piece of news is fake or real, after being trained upon a pre-defined dataset of flagged news articles ( "train.csv" ) .

This repo includes the code for the entire website, the python code solely for the ML part lies within "prakhar_ml_project_fake_news_finall.py"

Pressing the "Predict a news" button on the website leads to it going through the dataset to find a news article, predicting whether its fake, and then checking through the dataset to confirm whether its prediction is accurate or not. The model boasts a 97% accuracy rate :) Originally done on Google Colab
